## Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a decision support system using shiny app to demonstrate cab price variations between Uber and Lyft under different conditions such as weather, location and time. The final output could help passengers make an informed decision on choosing a better time to take a cheaper ride. This will also help the Drivers decide when is the optimal time to get businesses due to higher price and demand. To achieve this target, we obtained datasets from Kaggle.com and used R language to pre-process the data by replacing missing values, dropping unnecessary features and merging datasets. We trained various models using h2o library to select the one that results in lowest RMSE. The optimum model will be implemented in shiny app to provide an interactive user interface to the users.
